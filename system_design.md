## Clarifications and Considerations

### Data Consistency and Latency

To address the open question about data consistency and latency:
- Implement an intelligent caching system with tiered storage
- Use background data sync with configurable frequencies
- Add data validation mechanisms to cross-check between different sources
- Implement retry mechanisms and circuit breakers for API failures

### Performance Scalability

To ensure system performance with large datasets:
- Use database indexing strategies for efficient queries
- Implement data partitioning for historical analysis
- Utilize worker processes for CPU-intensive operations
- Consider cloud-based scaling for computational spikes during complex backtests

### Special Rules for A-share Market

For accurate simulation of A-share market rules:
- Implement dedicated rule engines for price limits, T+1 trading, suspension handling
- Create preprocessing tools for dividend adjustments and stock splits
- Maintain a calendar service for trading days and market hours

### Machine Learning Strategy Implementation

To balance ML model complexity:
- Implement feature selection tools to reduce dimensionality
- Provide cross-validation frameworks and overfitting detection
- Enable hyperparameter tuning with optimization techniques
- Support model versioning and A/B testing
